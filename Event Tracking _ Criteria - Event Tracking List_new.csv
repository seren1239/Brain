role_weight   ,number,"Weight based on actor + action type. role_weight is assigned automatically based on actor and action type:

For HUMAN:
- Reframing (cross-boundary move, direction-shifting edit): 3.0–4.0
- Evaluation (delete, selection, critique): 2.5–3.5
- Constraint setting: 2.0–3.0
- Domain knowledge contribution: 1.5–2.0
- Micro editing: 1.5–2.0

For AI:
- Generative Expansion: 1.0
- Conceptual Blending: 1.0
- Domain knowledge generation: 1.0
"
impact_factor,number,"Multiplier representing directional impact.impact_factor reflects the directional impact of an event:

2.0 = Cross-quadrant move, reframing, deleting >3 nodes, selecting multiple nodes 
      (major restructuring of semantic space)

1.5 = Medium-impact selection, pruning, adding strong constraints

1.0 = Standard generative or editing behavior, mild structure shift

0.5 = Micro editing that does not significantly alter meaning or structure
"
final_score,number,semantic_total_score × role_weight × impact_factor
,,
human_score_total,number,Total final_score for HUMAN actions.
ai_score_total,number,Total final_score for AI actions.
curve_human_ratio,number,HUMAN score / (HUMAN score + AI score); value from 0–1.
curve_ai_ratio,number,AI score / (HUMAN score + AI score); value from 0–1.
