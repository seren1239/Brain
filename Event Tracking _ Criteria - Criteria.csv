"The evaluation measures not the behavior itself (e.g., generating, editing, or moving nodes), but the degree to which that behavior alters the “semantic space” (idea space).
A score of 0 indicates no semantic change; scores from 1 to 3 reflect increasing levels of semantic impact, ranging from minor local adjustments to fundamental reframing.",,,,,,

",,
semantic_generative_score,number,"0–3 range, see rubric for details.",Generative Expansion,Whether new nodes or idea directions were added,"AI：generated 5 new directions
Human：manually added a new node"," 0 = no new idea
 1 = adds 1 small new idea
 2 = adds 2–3 distinct ideas
 3 = adds >3 diverse ideas"
semantic_blending_score,number,"0–3 range, see rubric for details.",Conceptual Blending,Whether concepts were blended to produce new combined ideas,AI：combined two nodes and created a new one," 0 = no blending
 1 = superficial linkage
 2 = clear cross-domain analogy
 3 = strong conceptual fusion creating new structure"
semantic_reframing_score,number,"0–3 range, see rubric for details.",Reframing,"Whether the problem was reframed by changing perspectives, direction, or underlying assumptions","AI：generated content that shifted the problem direction
Human：edited AI content to shift the direction",0 = no reframing; 1 = minor adjustment; 2 = clear shift in perspective or assumption; 3 = full redefinition of the problem
semantic_evaluation_score,number,"0–3 range, see rubric for details.",Evaluation,"Whether evaluative actions were taken, such as judgment, critique, deletion, or prioritization (e.g., AI generating a critical card; user deleting or editing nodes)","AI：generated a critical card
Human：deleted certain nodes",0 = no evaluation; 1 = light preference/judgment; 2 = explicit critique or deletion; 3 = strong evaluative decision that changes direction
semantic_constraint_score,number,"0–3 range, see rubric for details.",Constraint Setting,Whether constraints were added or the design scope was narrowed,human：added constraints while editing a node,0 = no constraint; 1 = small constraint; 2 = moderate narrowing of scope; 3 = strong constraint that determines feasibility

semantic_input_score,number,"0–3 range, see rubric for details.",/,"Whether the original user input includes details about users, design problems, or contextual specifics",,0 = minimal input; 1 = basic task description; 2 = problem statement with context; 3 = complete design brief with scope + constraints + motivation
